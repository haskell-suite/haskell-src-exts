{- $intro
A directory contains a series of entries, each of which is a named
reference to a file system object (file, directory etc.).  Some
entries may be hidden, inaccessible, or have some administrative
function (e.g. `.' or `..' under POSIX
<http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/>), but in
this standard all such entries are considered to form part of the
directory contents. Entries in sub-directories are not, however,
considered to form part of the directory contents.

Each file system object is referenced by a /path/.  There is
normally at least one absolute path to each file system object.  In
some operating systems, it may also be possible to have paths which
are relative to the current directory.

-- Permissions

{- $permissions

 The 'Permissions' type is used to record whether certain operations are
 permissible on a file\/directory. 'getPermissions' and 'setPermissions'
 get and set these permissions, respectively. Permissions apply both to
 files and directories. For directories, the executable field will be
 'False', and for files the searchable field will be 'False'. Note that
 directories may be searchable without being readable, if permission has
 been given to use them as part of a path, but not to examine the
 directory contents.

Note that to change some, but not all permissions, a construct on the following lines must be used.

>  makeReadable f = do
>     p <- getPermissions f
>     setPermissions f (p {readable = True})

{- | Returns the current user's home directory.

The directory returned is expected to be writable by the current user,
but note that it isn't generally considered good practice to store
application-specific data here; use 'getAppUserDataDirectory'
instead.

On Unix, 'getHomeDirectory' returns the value of the @HOME@
environment variable.  On Windows, the system is queried for a
suitable path; a typical path might be
@C:/Documents And Settings/user@.

The operation may fail with:

* 'UnsupportedOperation'
The operating system has no notion of home directory.

* 'isDoesNotExistError'
The home directory for the current user does not exist, or
cannot be found.

{- | Returns the pathname of a directory in which application-specific
data for the current user can be stored.  The result of
'getAppUserDataDirectory' for a given application is specific to
the current user.

The argument should be the name of the application, which will be used
to construct the pathname (so avoid using unusual characters that
might result in an invalid pathname).

Note: the directory may not actually exist, and may need to be created
first.  It is expected that the parent directory exists and is
writable.

On Unix, this function returns @$HOME\/.appName@.  On Windows, a
typical path might be

> C:/Documents And Settings/user/Application Data/appName

The operation may fail with:

* 'UnsupportedOperation'
The operating system has no notion of application-specific data directory.

* 'isDoesNotExistError'
The home directory for the current user does not exist, or
cannot be found.

The directory returned is expected to be writable by the current user,
but note that it isn't generally considered good practice to store
application-specific data here; use 'getAppUserDataDirectory'

On Unix, 'getUserDocumentsDirectory' returns the value of the @HOME@
environment variable.  On Windows, the system is queried for a
suitable path; a typical path might be
@C:\/Documents and Settings\/user\/My Documents@.

{- | Returns the current directory for temporary files.

On Unix, 'getTemporaryDirectory' returns the value of the @TMPDIR@
environment variable or \"\/tmp\" if the variable isn\'t defined.
On Windows, the function checks for the existence of environment variables in
the following order and uses the first path found:

*
TMP environment variable.

*
TEMP environment variable.

*
USERPROFILE environment variable.

*
The Windows directory

The operation may fail with:

* 'UnsupportedOperation'
The operating system has no notion of temporary directory.

The function doesn\'t verify whether the path exists.
