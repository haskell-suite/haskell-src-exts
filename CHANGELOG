1.16.0 --> 1.16.0.1
===================

Include generated InternalParser.hs in the release tarball
(See http://ro-che.info/articles/2014-03-08-happy-alex-ghc-7.8 for details)

Other changes:

* Expose showToken from Language.Haskell.Exts.Lexer
* Show instance for SrcLoc and SrcSpan are changed (now they do not contain
* field names)
* Add DeriveGeneric to known extensions

** 1.15.x

1.15.0 --> 1.15.0.1
===============

* Eliminate inexhaustive patterns (and consequent bugs)
* The test suite for 1.15.0 wouldn't build due to a missing file in the source
  distribution. Fixed.

1.14.0.1 --> 1.15.0
===============

* Add support for extensions:
  - MultiWayIf
  - LambdaCase
  - DataKinds
* Remove support for old (deprecated) Generics
* Derive GHC's Generic instances for datatypes
* Derive some missing Data and Typeable instances
* Multiple bug fixes
* Add missing Functor and Applicative instances for monads
* Remove support for GHCs older than 7.4

** 1.14.x

1.14.0 --> 1.14.0.1
===============

Nothing has actually changed here (apart from the CHANGELOG). This release is
done to include InternalParser.hs generated with happy 1.19 so that it compiles
with GHC 7.8.

1.13.6 --> 1.14.0
===============

* Modernize the Extension datatype in L.H.E.Extension, following the lead
  of Cabal, to allow negative and positive extension modifiers (turning
  features on and off). You need to worry about backwards-incompatible
  changes if any of the following pertains to you:
  1) If you use the Extension datatype programmatically - it has changed
     significantly (see documentation).
  2) The ParseMode record now has one more field
     (baseLanguage :: Language), which might give you a type error.
  3) The behavior of the (extensions :: [Extension]) field has changed,
     which could bite you if you pass custom extensions in the ParseMode.
     Previously, the ParseMode defaulted to the list of extensions accepted
     by Haskell2010, and if you set the list explicitly you would override
     this. Now, the defaults are { baseLanguage = Haskell2010, extensions = [] },
     and explicitly setting a list of extensions will be interpreted on top of
     Haskell2010. See further the documentation for L.H.E.Extension.

* Add support for the 'capi' calling convention. It is enabled with the CApiFFI
  extension. It's been included since GHC 7.4, and advertised since 7.6.

* Add support for the 'interruptible' FFI safety annotation, enabled with
  the InterruptibleFFI extension.

* Give better error message when lexing newline fails. In particular, fix the bug
  when the parser would crash if the file didn't end with a newline.

* Support unboxed tuple expressions and patterns.

* Fix bug in lexing of primitive integer literals in hex or octal notation.

* Disallow negative primitive word literals
  (such as W# (-0x8000000000000000##)).

* Allow phase control for SPECIALIZE pragma.

* Derive Foldable and Traversable instances for all annotated AST types.

* Fix bug with pretty-printing WARNING and DEPRECATED pragmas.


** 1.13.x

1.13.5 --> 1.13.6
===============

* Allow 0-parameter type classes when MultiParamTypeClasses is on.

* Add support for NondecreasingIndentation. Previously it was always on,
  which is the default behavior in GHC. Now it is on only if enabled, or
  when using the newly added ghcDefaults extension set (instead of haskell2010).


1.13.4 --> 1.13.5
===============

* Expose Language.Haskell.Exts.Lexer, which implements
  a standalone token stream lexer. The module is
  re-exported both by Language.Haskell.Exts and by
  Language.Haskell.Exts.Annotated.


1.13.3 --> 1.13.4
===============

* Fix bug where operators starting with # written in
  parentheses would not be parsed when UnboxedTuples is
  turned on. Now works.

* Allow 'family' and 'forall' as (non-type) varid's. This
  adds one more shift/reduce conflict to the parser, and
  its resolution means that '{-# RULES "name" forall = ... #-}'
  is not allowed.

* Complete the set of FFI calling conventions from the Haskell
  2010 report (even if no compiler implements them). Also
  include the 'js' calling convention, supported by UHC.


1.13.2 --> 1.13.3
===============

* Fundep premises are now allowed to be empty.

* Fix the bug where the lexer would crash on a LINE pragma
  that did not include a line number.

* Fix the bug where the lexer would require the # of a
  MagicHash-style type constructor to be succeeded by at
  least one character in the file.

* Fix long-standing bug where the parser would crash with
  an ugly "Internal error" error message if encountering
  an extra }.

* Report errors at the right place for function arity
  mismatches. Earlier they were reported at end of file,
  now they are reported where the function is declared.

* Lexer now properly fails on line-breaks in string literals.

* Lexer now handles character escapes up to 0x10FFFF (unicode).


1.13.1 --> 1.13.2
===============

* Fix the bug with the precedence of unary prefix minus.
  Previously it was resolved as binding more tightly
  than any infix operator, now it is correctly treated
  as having the same fixity as binary infix minus.


1.13.0 --> 1.13.1
===============

* Allow an optional semi before the closing tag of
  an element. This achieves a similar effect for
  XmlSyntax in do blocks as DoAndIfThenElse does for
  the if construct. No more need to indent the closing
  tag one step further than the opening tag.

* Add a dummy 'noLoc :: SrcLoc' to L.H.E.SrcLoc, to
  use when generating code. It could definitely be
  done more elegantly, but not without inducing another
  major version bump, so later.

* Fix a regression from 1.11.x where the parser would crash
  upon encountering non-simple class/data declaration
  heads, e.g. 'data A [a]'. Now fails with a parse error
  as intended.


1.12.0 --> 1.13.0
===============

* Add extensions DoAndIfThenElse and NPlusKPatterns to
  Language.Haskell.Exts.Extensions.

* DoAndIfThenElse is now supported, at long last,
  making HSE compatible with Haskell2010

* Introduce haskell98 and haskell2010 extension groups,
  exported from Language.Haskell.Exts.Extensions.

* Backwards-incompatible change: default parse mode
  is now to use haskell2010, which means the following
  features are recognized by default: DoAndIfThenElse,
  PatternGuards, ForeignFunctionInterface, EmptyDataDecls.
  NPlusKPatterns is no longer recognized by default.


** 1.12.x

1.11.1 --> 1.12.0
===============

* Move from old [$...| quasi-quote syntax to the new [...| one.
  The old syntax is still recognized while parsing.

* Allow symbols as variables when TypeOperators is enabled.

* Rename ExplicitForall in ExplicitForAll, to be consistent
  with GHC and the Haskell' process.


** 1.11.x

1.10.2 --> 1.11.1
===============

* API change: the fixities field in ParseMode is now of type
  Maybe [Fixity].  If the field is Nothing the parsing will
  not try to do any fixity resolution whatsoever, otherwise
  it behaves as before.

* API change, bug fix: The Fixity type contains a QName rather
  than an Op to name the operator.  The operator must match
  the given QName exactly (i.e., unqualified names only match
  unqualified names, and qualified names only match qualified
  names) for applyFixities to perform fixups.

* Bug fix: End-of-file inside an OPTIONS pragma no longer loops.



** 1.10.x

1.10.1 --> 1.10.2
===============

* Fix a missing case in the Functor declaration for Decl. Thanks
  to Malcolm Wallace for the patch!

1.10.0 --> 1.10.1
===============

* Enable the unicode version of DoubleColon (x2237). Thanks
  to Andr�s Sicard-Ram�rez for the patch!

1.9.6 --> 1.10.0
===============

* Ensure that implied extensions are always picked up, not only
  when using the parseFile* family of functions as previously.

* Add the newly devised <%>...</%> syntax to the XmlSyntax support.
  This causes changes to pretty much everything, including adding
  a case to the AST which prompts the major version bump.


** 1.9.x

1.9.5 --> 1.9.6
===============

* Fix a bug (#203) where the lexer loops on malformed quasi-quoters.

* Fix a bug with pretty-printing RULES pragmas.

1.9.4 --> 1.9.5
===============

* Fix a bug where deriving clauses for GADT-style data declarations
  were not properly indented.

* Pretty-printing patterns is now more accurate in inserting (and not
  inserting) parentheses when needed.

1.9.3 --> 1.9.4
===============

* Pretty-printer now inserts parentheses in clever places when
  printing kinds.

* Pretty-printing expressions is now far more accurate in inserting
  (and not inserting) parentheses when needed.

* Pretty-printing negative expressions no longer inserts a superfluous
  space between the - and the expression.

1.9.2 --> 1.9.3
===============

* Constructors for newtype declarations must now have exactly one
  argument. This is only when using the classic syntax, not with
  GADT-style syntax.

* Fix a bug where preceding commas in tuple sections were counted
  one too few.

1.9.1 --> 1.9.2
===============

* Fix a bug with pretty-printing lexer tokens.

* Fix a bug where non-colon TypeOperators could not be used in
  prefix mode.

1.9.0 --> 1.9.1
===============

* Export parseFileContentsWithExts from .Exts.

1.8.2 --> 1.9.0
===============

* OptionPragma is renamed to the more descriptive ModulePragma,
  and adds a constructor AnnModulePragma for handling ANN pragmas
  preceding module header.

* Add instances for Eq/Ord/Data/Typeable for Fixity.

* Add 'parseFileWithComments' and 'parseFileContentsWithComments'
  to L.H.Exts .

* More informative error messages when HSX tags are mismatched.



** 1.8.x

1.8.1 --> 1.8.2
===============

* Don't insert redundant parentheses around record constructions
  and updates.

1.8.0 --> 1.8.1
===============

* Fix three bugs with the handling of ANN. I must have been really
  tired when implementing that support.

1.7.2 --> 1.8.0
===============

* Add an instance Show Fixity (derived).

* Support for the new ANN and INLINE_CONLIKE pragmas.

* Export knownExtensions from .Extension.

* Remove support for CFILES and INCLUDE pragmas. The support wasn't
  correct anyway, as it assumed the pragmas appeared at the top of
  files. As CFILES/INCLUDE pragmas can (and do) appear anywhere,
  there's no hope to support them in the AST. Better to remove the
  support altogether. Files with CFILES/INCLUDE pragmas can still
  be parsed of course, but those pragmas will be handled as comments.

* Parsing with ignoreLinePragmas = False now correctly updates the
  file name.

* Allow the whole SPECIALISE/INLINE family of pragmas in instance
  declarations. The InsInline constructor is removed, and is now
  represented by InsDecl (InlineSig ...).

* Fix a bug with line numbering and quasi quotes, and a similar one
  with line numbering and CDATA.

* Fix a few minor bugs in the exactPrinter.

* Fix the strange handling of so called strings in LINE pragmas.

** 1.7.x

1.7.1 --> 1.7.2
===============

* Fixes a bug in lexing LINE pragmas (used when ignoreLinePragmas
  is set to False).

1.7.0 --> 1.7.1
===============

* UnicodeSyntax now also enables the forall symbol (U+2200).

1.6.1 --> 1.7.0
===============

* Operators defined on the form

     (a `op` b) c = ...

  could not be handled by the (annotated) AST, nor the parser. I had to
  change the definition of the AST node for InfixMatch to allow a list
  of right-hand subpatterns, i.e.

     InfixMatch l (Pat l) (Name l) (Pat l) ...

  has become

     InfixMatch l (Pat l) (Name l) [Pat l] ...

  I also had an epiphany and fixed the issue that would arise with
  exact printing of prefix definitions including parentheses, so
  that now works too!

** 1.6.x

1.6.0 --> 1.6.1
===============

* UnicodeSyntax now works not only for identifiers, but also for
  ->, <- and =>, as well as Arrows arrows and kind stars.

1.5.3 --> 1.6.0
===============

* (=~=) turns out to be too general at Functor (for intuitive and not
  technical reasons), so is specialised to Annotated to closer mirror
  the original intention.

* applyFixities is hoisted to a monad, and now fails on ambiguous infix
  expressions.

** 1.5.x

1.5.2 --> 1.5.3
===============

* Several small bug fixes in the exact printer, and fail more gracefully
  if the number of srcInfoPoints doesn't match the needs of the node.

1.5.1 --> 1.5.2
===============

* Fix a bug in the exact printer that made it always print the first token
  at position (0,0).

* In fixing the above, Annotated is now a superclass of ExactP. It was already
  a superclass in spirit, and nothing can break from this since ExactP is only
  exported abstractly.

1.5.0 --> 1.5.1
===============

* The pretty printer now introduces parentheses for non-atomic arguments to
  function application. Note that infix applications are left untouched, no
  parentheses will be inserted there, as it is assumed that fixities are
  already properly resolved.

* Fix a bug in the pretty printer where view patterns and n+k patterns were
  not properly parenthesised.

1.4.0 --> 1.5.0
===============

* Add support for acting on LINE pragmas while parsing, i.e. updating the source
  position according to info given in LINE pragmas. This is done conditionally
  based on a new flag ignoreLinePragmas in the ParseMode, hence the need to
  increase the major version.

** 1.4.x

1.3.5 --> 1.4.0
===============

* The AST node for Proc in the simple AST is changed to include a SrcLoc argument,
  to make it consistent with similar nodes e.g. Lambda. This is specifically needed
  for transformation of patterns in HSX.


** 1.3.x

1.3.4 --> 1.3.5
===============

* Added an entry point in the parser for statements, and an instance Parseable Stmt
  to go with it.

* Ensured that .Annotated exports all relevant parseXXX(WithYYY) functions.

1.3.3 --> 1.3.4
===============

* Operator fixities are now resolved in patterns.

1.3.2 --> 1.3.3
===============

* Fixes a bug where qualified keywords are rejected even if the extension that
  enables the keyword in question is not turned on.


1.3.0 --> 1.3.2
===============

(Let's forget 1.3.1 ever existed.)

* Fix a bug where declarations of infix operators were not properly merged as FunBinds.
